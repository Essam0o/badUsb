A script that copies all files to your usb flash drive once u insert it 
# Next 

Copy all 4 files created in the above steps and put it on the root of the Flash drive, including the icon file if needed. Also create a folder named “all” where the contents are to be copied automatically. You can call this folder by any name, but then you need to reflect the changes you made in step 2.
This is all that needs to be done. Test the Flash drive on your own computer first before playing it out on your victim. It works flawlessly.
